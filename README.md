This program minimizes a 2d function using the [Minute2](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classROOT_1_1Minuit2_1_1Minuit2Minimizer.html) which is a [ROOT](https://root.cern/) function used to minimize the multidimesnioal functions. 
## How to Run the Program?
The program can be run using root macro. Go to the [ROOT](https://root.cern/) terminal root[0] and use the command  **`.x MinimizeFunc.C`** . It will the minima as an output in the same terminal. You can run it from your machine terminal by just typing **`root MinimizeFunc.C`**
## Reference 
A nice example of it can be found [here](https://root.cern.ch/root/html534/tutorials/fit/NumericalMinimization.C.html).
